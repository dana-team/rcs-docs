# rcs-docs

Repository to store docs about `Run Container Service` (RCS). Based on `MKDocs`.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with the desired changes.
3. Create a pull request to the `dev` branch.
4. After the PR is merged, check your changes at [Docs preview](https://dev--illustrious-custard-c6931e.netlify.app/)

The `dev` branch will be merged into `main` with every release, and a CI pipeline builds an image for offline use.
